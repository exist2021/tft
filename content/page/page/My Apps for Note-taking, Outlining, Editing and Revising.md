Here are the apps I use for my writing. Writing is a multi-step process and not one single work, so unfortunately no single app does it all.

## Typically writing consists of the following steps

Note-taking

Outlining and Writing

Editing

Revising (if possible)

Below I describe the steps and why I use these apps. In case you have any app suggestions on replacing them, do leave the recommendations in the comments.

## 1. Note-taking

Note-taking is the recording of the insights and thoughts which come to you as you are thinking about your problems. I jot it down in “The Archive” if I am on the mac, or I use 1Writer or Metion on my iPad or iPhone.

*Note -Here I am assuming you have highlighted and made notes from your research and reading. I am talking about post-research apps which are more focused on writing apps only.*

## 2. Writing and Outlining

I then move to [Writex](https://writex.io/) for outlining and writing my drafts. Writex gives me vertical columns where I can compare my text in columns (side by side) and then work on polishing the same. It has even a wiki area which automatically highlights and connects important words which you have elaborated in your wiki.

> Note — Now writex is a new app and has bugs. . The developer’s email is bouncing back and neither does he bother to reply on Twitter.

## 3. Editing

Now I would like to revise each sentence one by one. I write in MD so I move the content to[ Stackredit ](https://stackedit.io/)where I switch to HTML view and use a code in my MD document to break my paragraph sentence by sentence to view them in each line.

I then copy-paste the final MD output into “The Archive”. I use the find and replace all features to remove all the line breaks, all at one go.

*Note- You can also use an app called *[*essay *](https://essay.app/)*which will help you do this if you are ready to shell out 6$ per month.*

## 4. Revising

This is a luxury as I am well past my submission deadline but [Writex](https://writex.io/) also provides readability and spelling. Grammarly is also doing its work to ensure that I don’t make silly typos and grammar errors.

Are you paying for a email address? Are you a small business or a freelancer? Do you keep buying new domains and need emails for them?  If your answer is YES, then you should read further.

## Emails are getting expensive and all freebies plans are over.
Nowadays, emails are costing a lot more than it used to do. I remember in early days they would offer emails free when you purchased a domain. One of the earliest domains I have still has a free email from Godaddy, also i still have a free custom domain email id from Gsuite ( Now known as Google Workspace) for free. Google has stopped the Suite Legacy plan and [has made people pay for it](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60217?product_name=UnuFlow&visit_id=637967487199948467-450874955&rd=1&src=supportwidget0).

## Google Workspace Woes

I literally had about five domains and I had separate google workspace accounts for each of them and was paying for all five google workspace email id. The payment was not so much of a bother, but the administrative part was getting on my nerves. Every time I had to sign into different workspaces and different gmail accounts. But what broke the camel’s back was that RBI changed the rules for credit cards transactions. Now all payments need to authorised by the user and the process is rather buggy. The bank sends you a link via sms every time your payment is declined, then with that link you approve the business who is trying to charge the card. The links sometime don’t arrive and sometimes you cannot figure how to login to it. It is a complete mess. All my five payments were failing every month and I was manually doing the payments.

### Google Workspace Support is complex
The path to creating a google workspace account is also designed to businesses and not individuals (obviously). I tried to create a new account, and when I entered my mobile number for verification, it gave me an error notification saying “This number has been used many times to create email accounts”. Hell, am I am outlier who has five workspace emails?

I reached out on twitter, the support guys asks me to use another number, I rage on him, that I cannot spend 100 $ to buy a new SIM card and a new phone to get a new email which is 2 $. He relents and then asks me to fill a form. I get a reply to the form in a couple of days. In the meanwhile I have shut all my account and moved on.

## Get an alias email id
I had always heard about an alias, but never had dug deep into what it means, until I came across [this article](https://medium.com/@artpi/how-to-set-up-a-gmail-custom-domain-for-free-50fd73bc451d) on the same. I followed the instructions in the article and then made an alias for each of my domain in to my primary gmail account. Now with one gmail account, I can control and manage my five other custom domain emails.

## Email Nirvana
I feel so relieved that I am now just using one email interface to manage all my five email ids and that also when all of the emails are free. Saved 600 Rs per month in subscription and lot more in peace of mind which is priceless.

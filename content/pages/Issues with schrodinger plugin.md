There is problem with images uploaded locally as assets. The export should create a asset folder which doesn't happen sometimes. I tried to manually drag the image to the asset folder for Github but still the image doesn't display. So I am currently hosting my images on this blog else where, which adds a bit of friction as an additional step to my publishing workflow.

I have raised the issue with [Aryan Sawhney]({{< ref "Aryan Sawhney" >}}) but the communication hasn't been so clear yet.

I recently thought that every app does one thing well. These special-purpose apps are an indispensable part of our workflow, but the money I might have to spend on subscriptions was getting out of the budget. Hence I decided to give [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) a chance after having discontinued my subscription a few years back, and I am back again to it. 

> Below are some apps you might find useful if you are a PKM worker.

# Writing
Writing helps us to see how much we know. If we know the subject well, we can communicate it well; if we do not know the subject well, we cannot communicate it. Period! 

The writing apps I use in Set apps is

## Ulysses
Though I prefer iA Writer over [Ulysses's writing app](https://ulysses.app/), you could give Ulysses a spin if you haven't purchased iA Writer. 

> Ulysses is available on Setapp for both Mac and iOS.
## Note-Taking apps
I use [The Archive as my zettelkasten note-taking app](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/), along with apple notes for shorter and for longer notes, I use [Logseq](https://logseq.com/). 
I use [craftdoc](https://www.craft.do/) for a project where I have a collaborator.
### Craftdoc
[Craftdoc](https://www.craft.do/) is a beautiful iOS first note-taking app which works like an outliner. It shines when you are a team and has to leave comments on each other notes. It also has introduced some AI assistants, which are handy for expanding your thought. It also has a handy feature to quickly transfer your notes and tasks to other applications like [Noteplan](https://noteplan.co/) or [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/).  

> Craftdoc is available on Setapp for both Mac and iOS.
### Noteplan
I tried [Noteplan](https://noteplan.co/) for a while but have decided to stick to Craftdoc, since it suits my purpose much better. 

> Noteplan is available on Setapp for both Mac and iOS.
### Sidenotes
[Sidenotes](https://www.apptorium.com/sidenotes) is an amazing notes app at the side or edge of your screen. A convenient keyboard shortcut can make it slide out for you to take notes while doing your research. I use this app when I am researching. 

> Only The Mac version is available on Setapp.

## Project Management
Project management is always tough because I am a solo worker, and the people I work for aren't into software and projects. For my projects, I have tried various apps, but one of the direst needs for me is to see my projects on a TimeLine. This is where [Aeon Time Line](https://timeline.app/) comes to aid.

### Aeon TimeLine
[Aeon TimeLine](https://timeline.app/) is not built for projects. It was originally built for fiction writers who need to keep track of chronological events. But it is a very interesting application for visualising your project timelines. They have set up project templates where you can jump-start immediately. 

> Only The Mac version is available on Setapp.
## Other Apps which are important for Personal Knowledge Management.
### Popclip
[Popclip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) isn't a note-taking app, but it facilitates note-taking. Whenever you select a text, the [Popclip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) app is activated, and you can perform loads of actions like sending that copies text to Ulysses or [Sidenotes](https://www.apptorium.com/sidenotes), you can also do a google or Twitter search. Below is the set of actions I have configured.

### Cleanshot

[Cleanshot](https://cleanshot.com/) is the best screenshot app out there. You can immediately take a screenshot, annotate it, blur it, upload it on their server to share a link etc. 

I feel during note-taking, one needs to take a lot of screenshots, and Cleanshot is a must-have app.

I had never really used tables inside a MD note, until I realised I am turning 50 next month and it is high time, I get organised and start writing down my daily expenses but I wanted to incorporate them into my note-taking routine rather than go about opening an Excel file or some special purpose accounting software.

I find the Excel kind of program so inconvenient unless they provide an embed code into markdown files, which as per my knowledge only [Writer – iA](https://ia.net/writer) has content blocks which convert any CSV files into MD tables. Check [this thread](https://twitter.com/rcvd_io/status/1549001094671515648) for some examples.

So instead of struggling with Markdown [like this](https://hackmd.io/s/how-to-create-table) you can just use the table flip app and insert tables into your MD notes.

## What is Table Flip

[TableFlip - Simple Table Editor for Mac](https://tableflipapp.com/) is a handy piece of software developed by [Christian Tietze](https://twitter.com/ctietze).

When I was looking for a way to conveniently add tables to my markdown notes. I discovered it and now the lazy me, instead of learning MD uses this app to quickly turn tables into MD notes or insert tables into my daily note-taking.

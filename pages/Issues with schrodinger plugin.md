## Image Issue

  + There is problem with images uploaded locally as assets. The export should create a asset folder which doesn't happen sometimes. I tried to manually drag the image to the asset folder for Github but still the image doesn't display. So I am currently hosting my images on this blog else where, which adds a bit of friction as an additional step to my publishing workflow.

  + ## Updates

    + This issue has been resolved on 16th August 2022 by [Aryan Sawhney]({{< ref "Aryan Sawhney" >}}) but with every Logseq update this bug comes back. I hope [logseq]({{< ref "logseq" >}}) get it's shit together and stops breaking the images in my site. Till then, I am hosting images elsewhere so the images don't break. In case you see missing images in any blogpost, logseq is to blame.

    + [Aryan Sawhney]({{< ref "Aryan Sawhney" >}}) has informed me on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/725182569297215569/853262815727976458/1011568102535860264) that the [logseq]({{< ref "logseq" >}}) team is working on a new API for images and this image issue will be once and for all resolved once the same is implemented.
